# flask_app_creator

the title says it all. Save time creating the basic initial python file and directories for flask app creation. Focus on making your flask app unique instead of doing the boring preliminary work. This is set up specifically for personal use, so there are no configuration options as I create most of my flask apps exactly the same. Feel free to fork and make more customizable.
